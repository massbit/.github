# Code of conduct

> *Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.*

<br/>

Collaboration are welcome for each one of my **public** projects. I strongly believe in open source and will continue to encourage politely contributions and participations to all the discussions involving issues or problems reported by the community.
