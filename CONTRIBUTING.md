# Contributing

Collaboration are welcome for each one of our **public** projects.

## Issues

If you find an issue in one of the repositories, please check if it's already known by searching inside it's issue section, otherwise feel free to file a new one.

## Pull Requests

After opening an issue, you may want to further contribute.
That's amazing!\
However you must follow these two simple steps in order to get your PR considered and then merged:

1. [Fork the project](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

2. Open a Pull request against `master` or `main` branch.
   Blank PRs have a template you can follow to describe your edits in details.
   **Always request a review of the code to, at least, one maintainer.**

If the project has a test suite configured be sure to check it's results before and after applying your changes and opening the PR.

Always remember to be kind and patient.

Thanks!
