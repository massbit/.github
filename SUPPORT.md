# Development support

## Need help?

If you need support for a functionality that you're developing just create a new issue or link the pr, that you're working on, in a previous one.

Remember to add the label "help wanted" to request help from the community.

## How to help somebody

If you're looking to help someone just check in the issue tab of a project and filter by:
